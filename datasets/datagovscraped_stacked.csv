Also, as AME pertains to mean earnings, it can be skewed upwards by a small number of very high income earners.

All food retail establishments must be licensed in order to operate.  Each licence application is assessed on its own merits. Here is a self-checklist for easy reference on the requirements to fulfill.
In general, NEA will issue a foodshop licence when the following conditions are met with: 
Compliance with the Code of Practice of Environmental Health (COPEH) and operational requirements for foodshops, which covers areas like minimum kitchen size, refuse management, noise and cooking fumes control etc.  Please study the requirements appended. They will be verified through a pre-licensing check of the premises upon the completion of renovations and installation of equipment. 
 Submission of relevant approvals and supporting documents 
a. Approval from the land agency e.g. URA and HDB (referred to as planning permission from land agencies) 
b. Tenancy agreement# 
c. Details of applicant - one of the following (where applicable): 
    i. Individual - Both sides of NRIC 
    ii. Company - Information Business Profile from Accounting & Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) 
    iii. Society - Certificate of Registration from Registrar of Societies 
d. Basic food hygiene certificate/Refresher food hygiene certificate of foodhandlers 
e. Food hygiene officer certificate (for Food caterers, Restaurants, Foodcourts and Canteens only) 
f. Cleaning program 
g. Layout plan of premises (in scaled metric units) 
h. Letter of authorisation (when submission of application is not done by intended licensee/director of company holding the licence) 
i. Pest control contract covering the control of rodents, cockroaches and flies during the year-long licensing period. The inspection frequency of the food shop premises covered in the contract shall be at least once a month to detect any sign of pest infestation. 
j. Supplementary Information form to capture business name, type of food sold, business operating hours, etc. 
k. Food Safety Management Plan (with critical control points identified) or proof of registration for the “WSQ Apply FSMS for Food Service Establishments” course. (For Food Caterers only). Refer to the following link for more details. 
l. Photos showing the interior and exterior of the catering vehicle

Please notes that the submission of a tenancy agreement is not required during the initial stage of application for a licence. The tenancy agreement will only be required at the final stage, before NEA approves and issues the licence. You are advised not to sign any tenancy agreement, until the land agency concerned has approved the relevant use for the premises, and you are reasonably confident you can meet with the COPEH requirements by also verifying with the owner/landlord on the necessary renovations like installation of exhaust system, pipings for sinks etc.","February 19, 2016","May 21, 2015",CSV,"January 1, 1993 to December 31, 2014",Singapore Open Data Licence

It includes persons who are mainly or partially engaged in R&D. The Survey’s reporting convention for the headcount of those engaged in R&D is the number of persons as at the last day of the one year reporting period.
One full-time equivalence (FTE) unit may be thought of as one person-year. A person who spends 30% of his time on R&D and the rest on other activities during the one-year reporting period should be considered as 0.3 FTE. If a fulltime R&D worker is employed for only six months during the one year reporting period, this results in a 0.5 FTE
R&D manpower comprises the three occupation groups defined and described below: researchers; technicians; and other supporting staff. Researchers are further sub-classified as follows:


Research scientists and engineers (RSEs) comprise the researchers, excluding the fulltime postgraduate research students, who hold formal qualifications at the university degree level. RSEs are classified into three subcategories according to the highest level of the formal qualifications: PhD; master degree; and bachelor degree.


Non-degree researchers comprise the researchers, excluding the full-time postgraduate research students, who hold formal qualifications below the university degree level.


Full-time postgraduate research students (FPGRSs).

Notes :
1) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings (AME) refers to all remuneration received before deduction of the employee Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions and personal income tax. It comprises basic wages, overtime pay, commissions, allowances and bonuses but exclude employer CPF contributions. 
2) Data cover full-time and part-time employees who have CPF contributions. They exclude identifiable self-employed persons who have made CPF contribution. 
3) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings covers employees who contribute to the Central Provident Fund. Available quarterly, AME provides a timely rough gauge of average wage movement. However, the AME can be influenced by the changing mix of full-time and part-time workers and variations in overtime as the data are compiled based on the payroll of contributors to the CPF which do not allow for breakdown separately to full-timers and part-timers. Also, as AME pertains to mean earnings, it can be skewed upwards by a small number of very high income earners. For income of a typical worker, users should refer to the median Gross Monthly Income From Work and for wage growth of employees over a year they can refer to the Annual Wage Changes, both of which are available on MOM’s website.","April 1, 2021","January 28, 2019",CSV,"January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2020",Singapore Open Data Licence

Coastal and Marine Habitat Map of Singapore 2010/2011,/dataset/coastal-and-marine-habitat-map-of-singapore-20102011,National Parks Board,"Mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and coral reefs are three of the most important coastal habitats of the world. Mangroves not only provide valuable ecosystems services such as coastal erosion protection, water filtration and the areas for fish and shrimp breeding, they also harvested as building materials and are used as medicine. Seagrass beds provide feeding and nursery grounds for many organisms, such as dugongs and juvenile fish. They also anchor sediments, protect shorelines from erosion, remove nutrients and help control coastal water quality. However, these habitats are also the most vulnerable ecosystems worldwide and experienced a dramatic decline. They can be affected or degraded by oil pollution and water sedimentation due to shipping activities and coastal reclamation.
To protect and preserve the coastal habitats, it is necessary to monitor the status of habitats regularly. In order to achieve that, a map with detailed classification of the habitats plays an important role in the understanding, monitoring and aid in the decision making process for an effective management of the coastal habitats. 
The objective of this study is to generate a large scale habitats map of Singapore using high resolution satellite imagery.

The Planning Regions are divided into smaller Planning Areas. Each Planning Area is further divided into smaller subzones which are usually centred around a focal point such as neighbourhood centre or activity node. 
The Master Plan is a forward looking guiding plan for Singapore's development in the medium term over the next 10 to 15 years and the planning boundaries may not coincide with existing developments for some areas.","December 23, 2019","December 23, 2019",KML,N/A,Singapore Open Data Licence

Tree Conservation Area,/dataset/tree-conservation-area,National Parks Board,"On 2 August 1991, in an effort to control indiscriminate felling of mature trees, two areas in the South Central and Eastern parts of Singapore were gazetted as Tree Conservation Areas [under the Parks and Trees (Preservation of Trees) Order 1991]. The two Tree Conservation Areas (TCAs) were selected based on the extent of greenery and the number of mature trees within the areas that are worth conserving. These mature trees provide the lush verdant and wooded ambience to enhance the beauty of the environment. Some of these trees have taken as long as 50 to 100 years to reach their present size.
The gazette requires written permission for proposals to fell any mature tree to be obtained from the Commissioner of Parks & Recreation. Mature trees are defined as trees with girth more than one metre measured half a metre from the ground. This applies to developers as well as owners of private properties and even if no development works are being undertaken.
This dataset presents the indicative extent of the two TCAs.","November 7, 2018","November 7, 2018",N/A,N/A,Singapore Open Data Licence
